# Send a Share to another app

*Share a file or plain text with another app*

To share a file with another app, the file must be in shared storage. A shared file or plain text can be sent directly to another app (if it will accept it), or via a share sheet which shows apps that claim they will accept it.

The example illustrates sharing plain text, a file in this app's shared storage, or a file chosen with the picker.

The buildozer options are documented in [BUILDOZER_README.txt](https://github.com/RobertFlatt/Android-for-Python/blob/main/share_snd/BUILDOZER_README.txt)
